Changelog
=========

## Version 5.3.0

- Fixed: WeekView no longer ignores uses day background colors set in code or XML.

## Version 5.2.4
*(2021-02-14)*

- Changed: The `jsr310` module now uses core library desugaring, which allows it to be used starting at API 21 instead of API 26.

## Version 5.2.3
*(2021-02-06)*

- Changed: The `emoji` module now initializes automatically on start-up. Calling `weekView.enableEmojiProcessing()` is no longer necessary.

Thanks for contributing, [RemiNV](https://github.com/RemiNV)!

## Version 5.2.2
*(2020-12-30)*

- Changed: `firstVisibleHour` now returns the first partially visible hour as an `Int` and takes into account `minHour`. To retrieve the first fully visible hour, you can use `firstFullyVisibleHour`.
- Fixed: WeekView now only calls `onRangeChanged()` when a scroll has finished. Previously, it would call it for every date that it scrolled past.
- Fixed: WeekView now correctly preserves the first visible date when switching the number of visible days.
- Fixed: WeekView now scrolls correctly when used in the Fragment of a ViewPager.

Thanks to everyone who reported issues!

## Version 5.2.1
*(2020-11-25)*

This release fixes a build issue introduced in the last version.

## Version 5.2.0
*(2020-11-19)*

- New: WeekView can now display blocked times. To enable this, `WeekViewEvent<T>` was replaced by the sealed class `WeekViewEntity`, which can be of type `Event<T>` or `BlockedTime`. Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/thellmund/Android-Week-View/wiki) to get started.
- Changed: `WeekViewDisplayable<T>` is now deprecated. Now, submit elements of type `T` directly to WeekView’s adapter by calling `adapter.submitList(List<T>)`. Then, implement `onCreateEntity()` in your adapter to create a `WeekViewEntity` from your object. 
- Changed: The methods for scrolling to specific dates and times have been streamlined. You should now use `scrollToDate(date: Calendar)`, `scrollToTime(hour: Int, minute: Int)`, and `scrollToDateTime(dateTime: Calendar)`.
- Changed: WeekView no longer supports emojis by default. To add emoji support, you must add a dependency to `com.github.thellmund.Android-Week-View:emoji:x.y.z` and call `weekView.enableEmojiProcessing()` before submitting events.
- Fixed: WeekView no longer forgets to call `onEmptyViewLongClick()` if an empty area in the calendar was long-clicked.

## Version 5.0.3
*(2020-11-10)*

- Fixed: WeekView no longer ignores `goToCurrentTime()` if it’s already scrolled to the current date, but not the current time.

Thanks for reporting this, [FeFelten](https://github.com/FeFelten)!

## Version 5.0.2
*(2020-11-10)*

- Changed: WeekView no longer throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if `goToHour()` is called with an hour outside the accepted time range. Instead, it coerces the provided argument into the range of `minHour` and `maxHour`.
- Fixed: WeekView no longer renders very short events incorrectly.
- Fixed: WeekView no longer scrolls to the wrong time when calling `goToCurrentTime()`.

## Version 5.0.1
*(2020-11-03)*

- Fixed: WeekView no longer handles events incorrectly if their time zone is different from the device’s time zone.
- Fixed: WeekView no longer renders the bottom border of multi-day events incorrectly.

## Version 5.0.0

- Changed: WeekView no longer replaces events of months that have already been cached when using a paginated approach. To force-refresh the cache, call `refresh()` on an implementation of `WeekView.PagingAdapter`.
- Fixed: WeekView no longer crashes with a `ConcurrentModificationException` when submitting new events in quick succession.
- Fixed: WeekView no longer renders borders of multi-day events incorrectly.

## Version 3.1.2
*(2018-11-25)*
- Fix issue where a day’s events weren’t displayed until the user finished scrolling
